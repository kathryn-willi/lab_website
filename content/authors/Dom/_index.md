I began my professional journey by serving six years in the United States Marine Corps, finishing my service at the Presidential Helicopter Detachment (HMX-1). Since then, I have shifted my professional goals to academic endeavors, where I began to study interdisciplinary water resources, covering topics such as ecology, burn recovery, and water quality monitoring as an undergrad at CSU. I have now finished my tenure as a Marshall Scholar in the UK, where I focused on understanding macro-scale water quality monitoring using Remote Sensing and Machine Learning. I plan to continue this work at CSU for my Ph.D. and work with the Colorado Water Center, helping people from underrepresented backgrounds get involved in water resource issues in our state.
