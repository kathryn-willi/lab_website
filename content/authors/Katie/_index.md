Katie is the lab's manager and is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Watershed Science. Katie assists the lab on all sorts of projects, though a common thread within them is the munging and harmonizing of large datasets. Katie also co-teaches an environmental data science course (ESS 523a) that equips students with coding skills to make their research more efficient and less stressful.
